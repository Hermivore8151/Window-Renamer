# Window-Renamer
Silly little window renamer, made because its funny


# What does it do?
- Renames the window, it will ask for the original window title and the target name
- These are saved in new_name.cum and old_name.cum

# How do i set it up?
- Run the file
- Give names
- Setup finished, you can bring this up by deleting one/both of the files

# How do i use it?
- Run the .exe / .py once the target window is open, and it should just rename it and exit the script
